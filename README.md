# Django To-Do-List 

This is a simple, yet efficient, task management application built with Django. The to-do list allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, helping to keep track of important activities. Key features include:
* Task Descriptions: Each task includes a description field where users can enter details about the task.
* Completion Status: Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete. The status is reflected in the task list and helps keep the user organized.
* Completion Date: When a task is marked as complete, the completion date is automatically recorded and saved in the database. If a task is incomplete, the date remains empty.
* Real-time Updates: The list automatically updates when tasks are added, edited, or removed.
* User-friendly Interface: The front-end is designed using HTML and CSS, with a clean, intuitive layout for easy task management.
* PostgreSQL Database: The app utilizes PostgreSQL for efficient and scalable data storage, ensuring reliable task management across multiple sessions.
* DBeaver Integration: Database management is done through DBeaver, providing an intuitive interface for querying and managing the PostgreSQL database.
* Server-side Logic: All updates and modifications are handled on the server side, ensuring data integrity and minimizing front-end dependencies.

This to-do list application is ideal for managing day-to-day tasks and improving productivity.
